# WebRTC video chatting app
This is a prototype of webrtc video chatting app. what you are seeing is the experiment that I did whether it's actually working or not.

with this you can start video on two compters within same local network and chat with each other computer like you would in any online video chatting/meeting app.

As you know webRTC is a peer to peer protocol so server.js is only needed automate the communication of initial offer and answer exchange. you can even run it without server.js but it has some when running with same browser.
so using a server is best.

to do for next version:
1. login and registration for user
2. list of users available online and connect with each other
3. security since we are sharing video
